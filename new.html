      <p class="intro"> My dream is to found a start-up centered around leveraging AI to make a difference in my local
      and global communities. I'm not sure where to start just yet, but after spending years giving back
      to my community through events I organized as the Captain of the all-girls robotics team I founded,
      I've seen first-hand the positive impact that technology and science can have on the world. So join
      me as I figure out how to actualize my dreams into reality!
